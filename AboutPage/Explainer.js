				<h2>About the Game</h2>
				<p>
					The goal of this game is to clear the board and reach a target score.
				</p>
				<p>
					Game play is similar to candy crush, where you are trying to switch
					neighboring tiles to make three or more tiles of the same color line
					up in a row or column.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you align the tiles, matching tiles of three or more in a row will
					disappear allowing for the tiles above to fall down and more tiles
					appaer at the top of your board
				</p>
				<p>
					Each column as a set number of tiles that can appear in it. Once all
					hidden tiles appear on your board. Empty columns will start
					disappering
				</p>
				<p>You can not trade placing with an empty tile.</p>
				<p>
					There is a ranomize button that will randomly rearrange the visable
					tiles in to the bottom rows. So more tiles can protentianl fall and
					more moves can be made. You can only randomize your board a set number
					of times.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you can no longer make any moves or randonize your board, the
					game will end
				</p>
